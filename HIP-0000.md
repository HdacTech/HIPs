## Abstract

 A briefly describe of technical background and effects of the proposal.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for HIPs that want to change the Hdac protocol. 
It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the HIP solves.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. 
The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for the current Hdac platforms.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made.
The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Implementation

The implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Hdac protocol.

## References

This is a section for references such as links to other documents (BIP or HIP)
or to reference implementations.
